# DextoolTrendBot
The goal is to make Hugo Finance or what ever crypto in the ranking more popular by trying to use Ip rotating to not get blocked so we can send endless request to the API under certain 
Time restrictions and see where the crypto is being ranked by the algoritm. By clicking different links we simulate human like behavior into thinking people are voting for 
the crypto in question

We use basic Web scraping to get the data from the site and see where we rank
If there's a change by continous clicking and if  we get more popular we know the algorithm is being fooled


In order to run this script 24hours i set up a DigitalOcean Droplet Ubuntu server with a GUI so I can run the script from there
The second script will be my own Tradebot. The chances of fooling the algorithm that way will be higher and probabilistically much better
